# Random Spanning Tree Sampler in C
## Dependencies
- igraph: a C library for creating, manipulating and analysing graphs 
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/igraph/igraph)
  - [Installation Guide](https://igraph.org/c/)
- CMake and other build tools

## Currently Implemented Graphs
- Small graph generated by specifing edges
- Random connnected graph, for a given number of vertices, density target, maximum and minimum degree
- Full graph
- Many other graphs that are included in the igraph library [Graph Generators](https://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-Generators.html)


## Examples of Running Time

### 100 Vertices, 0.1 Density, No Maximum Degree Limit
```
Created graph with 100 vertices and 511 edges
...
100000 samples taken, with per sample time taking 36.17 us
Total time spent 3 seconds
```
This compares to the python implementation down from ~1ms per sample to 36us per sample. But still limited to linear performance improvement.

### 1000 Vertices
```
Created graph with 1000 vertices and 49714 edges
...
1000 samples taken, with per sample time taking 1.05 ms
Total time spent 1 seconds
```

### 10000 Vertices
```
Created graph with 10000 vertices and 24974 edges
...
1000 samples taken, with per sample time taking 18.21 ms
Total time spent 18 seconds
```

### Complete Graph, 10000 Vertices
```
Created graph with 10000 vertices and 49995000 edges
...
1000 samples taken, with per sample time taking 919.95 ms
Total time spent 919 seconds

```

MTT matrix method could do this in 90 seconds.

### Ring Graph, 1000 Vertices
```
Created graph with 1000 vertices and 1000 edges
...
1000 samples taken, with per sample time taking 16.95 ms
Total time spent 16 seconds
```

### 3D Lattice Graph, ï½ž30000 Vertices
```
Created graph with 35937 vertices and 107811 edges
...
1000 samples taken, with per sample time taking 29.75 ms
Total time spent 29 seconds
```

Lattice seems to be friendlier to Markov Chains.
